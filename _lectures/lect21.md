# You should each be in the In Progress column on your team's Kanban board

If you are not, FIX THAT FIRST before doing anything else.

* Before each team standup, update your Kanban board
* During each team standup, as each team member reports what they are working on, verify that this is reflected in the In Progress column of the Kanban board.
* There will be a team participation grade today with this rubric:
  - 100: 6 out of 6 team members are assigned to something in progress on the Kanban board
  - 80%: 5/6 team members are assigned
  - 60%: 4/6 team members are assigned
  - 40%: 3/6 team members are assigned
  - 20% 1 or 2 are assigned
  - 0% No team members are assigned.
 * If you are finished with your initial assignments, i.e. all of your issues are merged into main, then *assign yourself to help team members that need help*
 * Remember that at the end of the day, these are team level grades

# Modern SW Dev orgs are chill about most things...
# But being late for standup is NOT ONE OF THEM.
