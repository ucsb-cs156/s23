# If your team has submitted team03 (ten of twelve teams)

Please divide the 75 minutes of class time between

1. Retro (30-45 minutes)
2. Sprint Planning for Legacy Code project (30-45 minutes)

More on each of these below.

# If your team has not submitted team03 (two of twelve teams)

* You will be responsible for holding a 30 minutes retro outside of class
  - Please, **right now** before starting work on team03, work out when you are going to meet
  - Could be face-to-face, or over zoom; work that out too.
  - Deadline is midnight Monday May 29.
  - Possible tools: your slack channel, a [doodle](https://doodle.com/en/), a [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/)
  - Post the future meeting time and place (or zoom link) to your team slack channel
  - More details on what you'll need to do to verify that you held your retro below.
* Hold a standup on team03, and review the Kanban board to determine what still needs to be done
* Work on team03, and use `#help-lecture-discussion` on slack to ask for help
* 10% late penalty applies, and final deadline for submission is 11:59pm Tuesday May 23.

# Retro

The following instructions apply both to:
* the teams holdngretro held in class on Tuesday 05/23
* AND the teams making up the retro later in the week.

1. Visit your team's gdrive link (the one pinned to your team's slack channel)
   - In the linked team folder, there should already be a subfolder called `retros`, and in that folder, a document called `Retro1` from your 05/16 retro.
   - Add a second document called `Retro2`.  At the top, put the retro date (e.g. 05/23/23), the name of the person leading the retro, and the names of the team members participating (and any that are absent).
   - Ideally, the retro leader is a different person from the one that led the previous retro.
2. Conduct your retro.  If you need help remembering how it goes, these links may be helpful: 
   - General background on retros, including how to conduct a stop/start/continue <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html>
   -  If you want to change it up, here's [an alternative format suitable for beginners](https://retromat.org/blog/best-retrospective-for-beginners/).
   -  If you *really* want to change it up, the [retromat](https://retromat.org/) has hundreds of ideas for how to organize a retro.  Changing up the format keeps it interesting and may get better results.
   - One thing that some teams find helpful is to use your slack channel as a way for everyone to put in ideas; the idea is to not "press enter" until someone in the group gives a signal.  That way, no one sees what anyone else is typing ahead of time.  
   -  Or, you might try an free online retro tool such as one of the ones discussed in [this article](https://medium.com/productpeople/the-5-best-free-online-retrospective-tools-for-your-team-5cbb0b47f9c9).
   - If you use a free online tool, please invite the instructor (phtcon@ucsb.edu) and your team mentor to be part of the team, and include a link to the online output in your Google Drive document.  You don't need to duplicate the output as long as we can get to it from your Google Drive document.
3. If you don't use an online tool, record artifacts in your document.  These will vary depending on the style of the retro; if it's a start/stop/continue retro, it will include the list of thing that the team suggested should be stopped, started, or continued.
4. Include at least some discussion that looks at your previous retro's suggested experiment:
   - What did you suggest that the team try doing differently?
   - What was the outcome?
   - What did you learn, if anything, from the experiment?
5. Also include a suggestion for an experiment for the next sprint.

These instructions apply only to the teams making up the retro later in the week:

* Please include a screenshot of your zoom meeting, or a group photo showing who participated.
* As you conduct your retro, please reflect on factors led to the team not completing the project by the original deadline
* Please include some suggestions for what the team will do to avoid that from occuring during the project phase
