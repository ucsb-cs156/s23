* How to reset the db on dokku (TODO: Fill this in)
* Explain when you might need to do this

# Agile Retrospective

# Today (outline)

The most important aspect of Agile: The Retrospective

We "inspect and adapt".

* Pause all work/submission for team02/team03.
* Focus only on the retro, and do not rush through it.
* A retro that lasts less than 30 minutes raises questions about whether it is a good faith effort.
* Give it the time that it needs.

# Retrospective: the heart of Agile

The core principle of Agile is "inspect and adapt".  
* It was "inspecting and adapting" that led the original authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) to their ideas.
* It has been by "inspecting and adapting" that the Agile philosophy continues to grow and develop.

Inspect and Adapt is, in many ways, linked to the *Scientific Method*; 
* we observe
* we form a hypothesis
* we do an experiment

All in the service of doing a better job of software development.

In a retro, the team stops, pauses, reflects, and most importantly *comes up with an actionable change* for their practice.

# Today's Retro

* Start by having everyone take 5 minutes to read through this article: [https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html)
  - Really read it!  It has the instructions for the most important activity in today's class
 
* Next, choose a leader for your retro. It should be someone that has read the instructions and is comfortable leading the group. 
* Then, locate the Google Drive folder for your team.  It should be linked in your Slack channel with a `gdrive` link this:

Check that each member of the team is able to access the folder.

In that folder, create a folder called `Retros` and in that folder, create a document `Retro1`

Then follow the instructions in the [https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html) article for  Stop/Start/Continue retro.

In the document, write down who your retro leader is.

At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top, and a list of who participated
* A document with three parts, "stop/start/continue", and items from each member under the three categories
* Dot voting (three votes per team member participating) on the items in the document.
* A summary at the bottom on an "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

After the retro is done, you can:

* Ask a staff member to look over your GDrive document; they'll check it to make sure it has the required elements:
  - items from each member under start/stop/continue
  - dot voting
  - an experiment, including the criteria by which you can know whether the experiment was a success
