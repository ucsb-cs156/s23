If your team isn't yet at 100 points:

* Do a standup
* Look at the PRs you have and get everything code reviewed that's ready to be code reviewed
* Work to get things merged

If your team is already at 100 points but not yet at 110 or more:

* Discuss as a team: what are you your best candidates from the remaining PRs to get you there?
* Make a post with the team consensus and tag Prof. Conrad
* List the top three contenders (with links to the PRs) and give a brief explanation of where each one stands.

If your team is at 110 points or more:

* Start planning your video (see below).
